Background

Etymologically the word cryptography (Cryptography) is derived from the Greek, the Kryptos which means hidden and graphein which means writing (Prayudi, 2005). Beginning of cryptography understood as the science of hiding messages (Sadikin, 2012), but over the times to the present understanding of cryptography developed into a science of mathematical techniques used to solve security issues such as privacy and authentication (Diffie, 1976).


Discussion

Cryptography is the science and art to maintain the security of the message when the message is sent from one place to another. In principle, Cryptography has four main components: plaintext, which is a message that can be read ciphertext, ie random tidka message can be read Key, which is the key to doing Algorithm cryptographic techniques, the method to do enkrispi and decryption. Various kinds of cryptography:
1. Encode is changing the data into another form.
    Example :
路 RGW, Hex
路 ASC11, Hex
2. Decode is the opposite of encode, to change other forms of data into a form that can be read.
     Example :
路 Hex, RGB
路 Hex, ASC11
3. Encryption adalahmerubah data into a form that can not be read by using a key.
     Example :
RSA
4. Decryption is meruabah form of transcription of data into data that can be read megunakan key.
    Example:
Public key / in the share
Private Key / saved.
5. Hashing is the process of data processing in the same direction.
    Example :
md5
Cryptography This is used to check the downloaded files to be seen whether any editing middle of the road.



Conclusion

Cryptography is the study of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security, such as data confidentiality, data authenticity, data integrity, and authentication data. But not all aspects of information security can be solved by cryptography.
