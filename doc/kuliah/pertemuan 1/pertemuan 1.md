1. Background

It is undeniable at this point almost everyone can not be separated from the internet either browsing or use of media sosial.Namun did we ever think when we visit someone's website secure, of course the answer is no because at the moment there are many websites that are not secure.Namun there are also some websites that have a good security system, security system itself functions to monitor network access and prevent misuse of the network.

Therefore, it is necessary regarding the introduction of a security system jaringan.Agar know more about network security, then I will lay my little knowledge about network security.

2.Penjelasan Problems and Solutions

We may have heard about network security, but we do not know what the sense of security of this network?

Network security (Network Security) is a computer network is one thing that is very important to monitor network access and prevent misuse of the illegal network.

OSI reference model of open networks or OSI Reference Model for open networking is a network architectural model developed by the agency the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in Europe in 1977. OSI itself is an acronym for Open Systems Interconnection. This model is also called the model "seven layer OSI Model" (OSI seven layer model).
Before the advent of the OSI reference model, the computer network system is dependent upon suppliers (vendors). OSI seeks to establish a common standard computer networks to support interoperability between different suppliers. In a large network there are usually many different network protocols. The absence of a similar protocol, making many devices can not communicate with each other.
This reference model was originally intended as a basis for developing network protocols, despite the fact that this initiative has failed. The failure was caused by the following factors:
This standard reference model, when compared with the reference model DARPA (Internet Model) developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), very close together. The model is the base model DARPA TCP / IP protocols are popularly used.
A reference model is considered to be very complex. Some functions (such as connectionless communication method) is considered less good, while other functions (such as flow control and error correction) is repeated on multiple layers.
The growth of the Internet and TCP / IP (a real-world network protocol) to make the OSI Reference Model became less desirable.
Network security system itself is built on the basic concept Layer.Dimana Osi OSI Layer consists of seven layers (layers).

then we'll talk about the TCP / IP.TCP / IP has been used for a long time, and therefore there are many who use and develop TCP / IP even though its own security is so weak.

Similarities between the OSI model with TCP / IP

Each model uses a layered structure in explaining the data communication process.
Had the application layer, although there are differences in the function of the layer.
Each has a transport layer and the internet (network).
Each uses packet-switched technology in its data packet transmission. Packet-Switched technique is a method of sending data packets. The data packets can take the path (path) different addresses in achieving a common goal.
The difference between the OSI model with TCP / IP

OSI 7 layer has a layer of fruit, and TCP / IP only has 4 Layer.
TCP / IP layer is the "Specific Protocol", while OSI Layer adalahProtocol Independen.3.
The top layer of the OSI layers, namely application, presentation, and sessiondirepresentasikan into 1 layer Layer TCP / IP, that layer.
All the standard that is used in TCP / IP networks can be obtained secaracuma charge of the various computers in the InterNet, unlike the OSI.
Development of the ISO / OSI faltered not like TCP / IP.
For the long term, the possibility of TCP / IP will become standard networked world, unlike the OSI.
OSI developed a model based on theory, whereas TCPmengembangkan model after it has been implemented.
TCP / IP combines the presentation and session layer in the OSI applicationlayer.
TCP / IP combines the data link and physical layers into a single layer OSI.
TCP / IP is simple with 4 layers.
TCP / IP is more credible because of protocol. No network is built with the OSI protocol, even though everyone uses the OSI model to guide their thoughts.
Problems are often experienced in osi layer and a solution should be done!

Troubleshooting on layer 1

Layer 1 itself associated with physical connectivity to the network device. Problems often involves layer 1 between the cable and electricity, and is the reason for calling the help desk. Some common Layer 1 include:

Power device is off
Power device is disconnected
Wired network connection is loose
This type of cable is wrong
Cables damaged tissue
Broken wireless access point
Wireless settings wrong, for example SSID
How to troubleshoot problems that occur on Layer 1, first check that all electrical devices as up. This could be an obvious solution, but a lot of people who report problems or may also ignores devices that are within the network path from source to destination. If there are LED displays connectivity status, verify with the customer that they are signaled correctly. Visually inspect all network cabling and reconnect the cable to ensure a proper connection. If the problem is with the wireless, make sure the wireless access point operational and that the wireless settings are configured correctly.

When a bit of troubleshooting a problem, the technician should advise the caller through each step, what to look for, and what to do if an error is found. If it is determined that all Layer 1 issue has been addressed, it is time to travel up the OSI model to Layer 2. When a bit of troubleshooting a problem, the technician must immediately notify callers through each step, what to look for, and what to do if an error is found.

Troubleshooting on layer 2

At layer 2 itself the problem may be caused by faulty equipment, incorrect device driver, or switch configured incorrectly. When troubleshooting a problem, it may be difficult to isolate problems on layer 2.

An on-site technician can check whether the NIC is installed and working properly. NIC reseating, or replace the damaged NIC can help to isolate the problem. The same process can be carried out by network switches.

Troubleshooting on layer 3

At Layer 3, the technician needs to investigate the logical addressing used in the network, such as the IP address scheme. If the network uses an IP address, the technician verify that the device has the proper settings, such as:

IP addresses in the network that has been set
Correct subnet mask
Default gateway true
Other arrangements are required, such as DHCP or DNS


At Layer 3, some utilities can help with the troubleshooting process. Three of the most common command line is:

ipconfig - Shows the IP settings on the computer
Ping - basic network connectivity tests
Tracert - View the routing path between the source and destination provided
Most network issues can usually be resolved by using this Layer 1, 2, and 3 Troubleshooting techniques.

Troubleshooting on layer 4

If the Layers 1 through 3 all appear to be operating normally and engineers can successfully jamming ping the IP address of the remote server, it is time to check the higher layers. For example, a network firewall is used throughout the flow, it is important to check that the application TCP or UDP port is open and there is no sign filter was blocking traffic to these ports.

Troubleshooting on the layer 5 to 7

The technician should also check the application configuration. For example, when troubleshooting an email, make sure that applications are configured properly send and receive email server information. It is also necessary to ensure that the domain name resolution is working as expected.

Maybe it's an explanation of troubleshooting on OSI layer.


3.Kesimpulan and Suggestions

So it can be concluded that the OSI Layer is a basic concept in security jaringan.Lalu here we know that the parts and functions well at OSI Layer or layer TCP / IP.Hal explains that the TCP / IP that we know very vulnerable to attack because their security is not so strong.
