Background

What is IDS (Instrusion Detection System)
What is the difference IDS and IPS?
Discussion

IDS
Intrusion detection system (IDS) is software that runs on servers or network devices to monitor and track network activity. By using IDS, network administrators can configure the system to monitor network activity for suspicious behavior that could indicate unauthorized access attempts

IPS
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) such as IDS follow the same process to collect and identify data and behavior, with the additional ability to block (prevent) the activity. Network-Based IPS (NIPS) can detain and inspect all network traffic for suspicious behavior and code. Because it uses in-line models, high performance is a crucial element of the IPS device to prevent a bottleneck on the network. Therefore, NIPS is usually designed using three components to accelerate performance of bandwidth, among others Network Chips (network processor), Chips FPGA, ASIC Chips

Difference

The difference between IDS and IPS lies in its function, IDS serves to create a log / alert while IPS serves to block
Conclusions & Suggestions
(IDS) is software that runs on servers or network devices to monitor and track network activity. Firewall still has shortcomings, and therefore made IDS and IPS systems to help these deficiencies and optimize the performance of the firewall.
His advice, more and more systems that can rival the firewall so that the security system is awake again.
