Background
At this meeting I will discuss about Denial Of Service, Denial Of Service is the last way for the attack on a server.
Discussion
DOS (Denial Of Service) is a final way for a hacker to do if the hack attempts that do not manage to penetrate the system to make the server busy by the request that we sent so the server itself could not serve another request.

In the process of request usually hacker did not act alone but in a way to ask a friend by sending the IP, because if he did it alone may need several programs, so many take up a lot of RAM. It was referred to as DDOS (Distributed Denial Of Service).

The workings of the DDOS is to create a server to be down in the case of requests from the client, because the server has a maximum limit in response to a request made client. So we sent a request as much as possible to the maximum extent so that the server can experience down. When the server is unable to serve requests from the client it is called the "denied".

Is there any way to prevent it?

Maybe for now there is no way to prevent it. But we can minimize this is to:

Improving the capacity of service if an attacker or hacker did not increase the capacity demand.
IP blocking attackers or hackers through the firewall.
Incorporate all IP attacker inside the firewall.
Make Honey Pot.
Conclusions and recommendations

The conclusion is DDOS is one of the last ways that do if the attacker can not penetrate a system, but the attacker can do a direct attack on the server so that the server is down. When the server is down all requests from the client will be canceled (denied).
