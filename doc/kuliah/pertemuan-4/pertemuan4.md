Discussion

Sniffing What is it?
As already explained, sniffing is the practice of reading the IP packets from one node to another node. The method used in sniffing is a method of intercepting, which the hacker network will enter into the path of data packets through the target.
Data traveling on the network to flow back and forth will be captured by using sniffing sometimes describes the contents of a request for comment or other specifications. When viewed from the structure of the web, either party can tap the whole or any of the traffic division of one of the machines in the network. Network control devices can also be set by an application or tool tapper to work at random or random.

Is there a way to prevent Sniffing?

According to the knowledge I had acquired no way to prevent it, if I can use the antivirus? firewall? of course not, because sniffing is done when the data is already out of the victim's computer and is in the computer network, so people who do not sinffing kmputer attack directly to the victim.
Conclusions and recommendations

conclusions by sniffing you can find or trace log data such as username and password.

My advice is not to carelessly use sniffing science without any significant purpose and not to harm others.
